--- Install Tools -------------------------

Make sure you got latest CMake installed on your system and your favorite IDE/compiler.

--- Install dependencies ------------------

Before compiling and linking one needs to install Boost, Glew, Glut, Qt.

--- Dependencies on Apple -----------------

Glut is already bundled with Mac, so no need to do anything for this.

Other dependencies can be easy installed using macport (you need to install macport if you do not already have it) or brew.
Replace version numbers with the latest ones if necessary.

sudo port install boost@1.53.0_1+no_single+no_static+python27+universal
sudo port install glew@1.9.0_0+universal
sudo port install libdevil@1.7.8+universal

--- Dependencies on Linux -----------------

--- Ubuntu based versions -----------------

Install dependencies:

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui freeglut3-dev libboost-all-dev libglew-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev libdevil-dev --assume-yes

This has been tested on a Bionic64 Virtual Box and results in the following versions:
- gcc 7.3.0
- cmake 3.10.2
- libglut.so.3.9.0, libGLU.so.1.3.1, libGLEW.so.2.0.0, libGL.so.1.0.0
- Boost 1.65.1
- libXi.so.6.1.0, libXmu.so.6.2.0

Depending on your environment, you might need to install the package ocl-icd-opencl-dev as well. OpenCL should be provided by your GPU driver though, or by the SDK (e.g. Intel, AMD) you're using.

Install Qt5 and point the path in CMakeLists.txt to it (we used version 5.11.0 and put it in the user's home directory).

--- Dependencies on Windows ----------------------

--- Howto compile and link  ------------------------

CMake should be used for generating make/solution files.

  $ mkdir Release && cd Release && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make

or using the GUI:

Open the cmake gui application

Browse the source path to the top most folder containing a CMakeLists.txt file.

For binary destination use the same folder location but add a
subfolder to contain the binary tree. You can name it whatever you
want. For instance "build". Press configure button, resolve any conflicts or issues.

Press configure button again until no red variables appear. Now press generate button.

Goto the build folder and locate your solution/make files and use these to compile and link the sub project.
